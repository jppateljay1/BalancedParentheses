# BalancedParentheses
A different approach to the classic balanced parentheses problem.

To introduce a new open and closed bracket in the system, just add it in the Initialize() as a new Pair(). 
As a demonstraction, pair 'u','i' was added, 'u' being the open bracket and 'i' being the closed. To expand further, one can also add 'a','b' as a pair.
